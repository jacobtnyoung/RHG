on a specific day of hoop.</p>
<p><em>Fellowship</em> (other usage is the term <em>Sweep</em>)-When a
single team wins every game played on a specific day of hoop. Strictly

members.</p>

<p><em>True fellowship</em>-When the first game winning 4 players sweep
the day including the championship with no subs.</p>

given day.</p>

<h4>Terms/Phrases Pertaining to “Checks”</h4>
<p>Courtesy-</p>
<p><em>Illegitimate</em>-A game stoppage used by the defense. The check

<p>Welfare-</p>

</div>
<div id="misc-termsphrases" class="section level4">
<h4>Misc Terms/Phrases</h4>
<p><em>Air decision</em>-Occurs when a player passes and the decision
for the target of the pass is made while in the air. See also the
sarcastic usage of “good pass”.</p>
<p><em>As deep as []’s wife</em>-Use to indicate a shot taken at
considerable distance from the hoop. The specific name mentioned between
the brackets is player specific.</p>
<p>Ave (also Ave-ing in)-</p>
<p><em>Bank</em>-A generic term to indicate the use of the backboard to
complete a shot. See Protractor for disambiguation.</p>
<p><em>Beeped</em>-When a player, during a shot attempt, experiences a
verbalized “beep” from another player. Some players, under particular
circumstances, will execute a “self-beep”.</p>
<p><em>Block party</em>-The occurrence of multiple blocks by one or
multiple defenders on one or multiple opponents.</p>
<p>Brandonoma-</p>
<p><em>Can’t teach strong/big</em>-When an offensive player, despite the
presence of good defense, prevails in a layup or closely contested shot
near the rim and the reason for their making the strong is attributed to
their strength or size. A close variation is: can’t teach fast, as well
as other derivative usages: can’t teach ______ .</p>
<p>Carnie shot-</p>
<p><em>Clearly egregious</em>-Used to indicate a traveling violation
that deserves added commentary given the egregiousness of the
violation.</p>
<p><em>Creeper</em>-A shot that does not directly go in immediately, but
instead, creates a moment of uncertainty, yet eventually goes through
the hoop.</p>
<p>Curable, but serious at its peak-</p>
<p>Curable, we think-</p>
<p><em>Dick is in</em>-Indication by another hooper that Dick will be
playing. Other usages vary widely but include (though not an exhaustive
list): I got Dick, Who has Dick?, Hey [insert player name], you take
Dick, etc.</p>
<p><em>Disqualified</em>-The person shooting in for the next game misses
everything.</p>
<p><em>Double-tap</em>-When a player knocks the ball out of bounds and
immediately before it goes out a player on the opposing team touches the
ball.</p>
<p><em>DQ, Dairy Queen Blizzard</em>-When one is shooting in between
games and misses everything including the rim, net, backboard, and the
chance of playing again.</p>
<p><em>Excuse me, sir and/or ummm, sir</em>-Used when a player on the
same team takes, at a minimum, 2 consecutive ill-advised shots on 2
consecutive possessions, resulting in zero points (and likely fast break
points for the other team due to the long rebound).</p>
<p><em>Full FDR</em>-When a player requires a knee brace for each
knee.</p>
<p><em>Half FDR</em>-When a player requires a single knee brace.</p>
<p><em>Good pass</em>-A term, used sarcastically, to mock the judgement
of a particular player after a poor pass.</p>
<p>Ill-advised-</p>
<p><em>In w #s</em>-A common, yet unnecessary, acknowledgment from one
submitting their name to hoop as no one would be able to play without
said #s.</p>
<p>Index game-</p>
<p><em>Is it?</em>-An opposing player questioning the execution of a
shot or pass, only to be dismayed.</p>
<p><em>Jump?</em>-1) when the ball is tied up between two players
(preferably on opposite teams), 2) when a play occurs and the outcome is
not immediately apparent and the ball is awarded to the team with the
possession arrow, 3) when a straightforward call is questioned in the
name of psych-ops.</p>
<p><em>Just the tip</em>-A contested pass that only touches the tip of
the defenders finger.</p>
<p><em>Justice</em>-When a debated call results in a change of
possession and in the subsequent position play ensues that nullifies the
prior debated call.</p>
<p><em>Layups?</em>-After several attempts to shoot-in for a game do not
yield a clear outcome, this term is used jokingly so as to suggest
speeding up the decision.</p>
<p>Look out, Gerald-</p>
<p>Mayvian flu-</p>
<p>MeAndy-</p>
<p><em>Move it back</em>-After several attempts to shoot-in for a game
do not yield a clear outcome, the players move the shoot-in shot from
the 3-point line to the free-throw line of the opposing side. Can also
be used to trick unsuspecting players by particular individuals.</p>
<p><em>Newly found illness</em>-</p>
<p><em>Niner-Niner</em>-Used to indicate a score of 9-9 or 19-19. See
Sixty-Nine for more particular usage.</p>
<p><em>Noon start</em>-An archaic term used in a bygone era to
coordinate a 12:00 pm start.</p>
<p>Not enough recent testing to know-</p>
<p><em>No 3’s</em>-An encouragement to the other team to shoot a 3 when
they need 2 to win, or, alternatively, an admonishment to the defensive
team from another defensive team member that seems to almost never
work.</p>
<p><em>Number 9</em>-Either the last person in the door who misses
playing in the first game or, alternatively, anyone who walks in the
door whom other players want to make feel bad whether they’re actually
the ninth player.</p>
<p><em>Out-the-door shot</em>-When a player tries to get in some extra
bicep curls before the game is officially over.</p>
<p><em>Protractor</em>-A term used to signal the use of an precisely
calculated angle when attempting a shot. Note the difference from bank
which is a generic term to indicate the use of the backboard. Protractor
is more specifically used to indicate the angle of the shooter’s
position.</p>
<p><em>Psych-ops</em>-A call or move with no rational purpose other than
to get one’s opponent to question the call.</p>
<p><em>Rule TA.1</em>-A rule governing assignment of incoming players to
a team that lost players or a new team. A shape-shifting concept
incapable of being documented that depends entirely on the vigor of the
advocate and his need for a roster upgrade.</p>
<p><em>Rick</em>-When a player attempts a shot that hits the portion of
the backboard that is vertical and perpendicular to the court.</p>
<p>Samsonite-</p>
<p><em>SHORT!</em>-A shot that only touches the tip of the rim.</p>
<p><em>Sixty-nine</em>-Remarked when the score is 6-9, 16-9, 6-19, or
16-19. Also, frequently mentioned subsequent to: Okay, it is 3-6, let’s
get a 3 here. Further, a 3 pointer made after announcing Sixty-nine is
followed by the term Niner-Niner if the team that was down evens the
score.</p>
<p><em>“Sparingly”</em>-Apparently means at least once or twice a game
in every game.</p>
<p>Sticky D-</p>
<p><em>Sub?/You ok?</em>-A question put forth to inquire as to whether a
player needs to be replaced. Used seriously and rhetorically in various
instances.</p>
<p><em>Taps</em>-Played to indicate that the outcome of a game is
seemingly inevitable given the disparity in the score.</p>
<p><em>Tomahawk</em>-When a defensive player attempts to block a shot
and egregiously chops at the offensive player.</p>
<p><em>Turnover</em>-Legal fiction.</p>
<p><em>Who’s got (insert players name)?</em>-Used to reference poor D on
an opposing player who continues to score…over…and over…and over.</p>
